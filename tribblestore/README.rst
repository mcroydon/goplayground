Tribblestore
============

Not to be confused with a `triplestore <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore>`_.

A really silly really simplistic `Tribble <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribble>`_ simulator in go,
because why not?

Installing
----------

If you don't already have a checkout of my goplayground, you can download just the cargo hold
and tribbles::

    $ go get github.com/mcroydon/goplayground/tribblestore/cargo_hold

Running
-------

Example::

    $ cargo_hold
    Is that a tribble?
    ...
    There are now 575 tribbles in the cargo hold.
