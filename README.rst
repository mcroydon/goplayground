Matt's Go Playground
====================

This is a place for small toy programs and other experiments that don't
warrant a full repository on their own.

* gowl: Serving ASCII owls over TCP faster than you should really be able to do such a thing.
* multicast-metar: A simple server that downloads a METAR for KLWC and broadcasts the raw METAR
  over multicast.
* serfsup: Peer to peer chat using Serf and Memberlist.
* similarity: The beginnings of a simple similarity or recommendation engine.
* tribblestore: A silly example of trying to contain tribbles.
